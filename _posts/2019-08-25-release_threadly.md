<a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/releases/tag/release-5.39">5.39</a> released, adding ConfigureableThreadFactory.builder() as an easier way to configure the ThreadFactory.  Also included are some minor internal improvements to ListenableFuture.map operations.  We are starting to formalize a 6.0 release, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/milestone/53">6.0 Release Milestone</a>.  If you have any ideas of what would be good to include in a upcoming 6.0, or even a future 7.0 release, feel free to open an <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/issues">issue</a>.
