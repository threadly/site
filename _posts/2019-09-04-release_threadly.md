As we start to think more about a 6.0 release, backwards compatible API changes have been provided in the new <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/releases/tag/release-5.40">5.40 release</a>.  In this we moved and renamed Watchdog into the new watchdog package.  As part of this we also added a new "PollingWatchdog" to be able to provide more flexible timeout mechanics when desired.
