Today we are happy to announce another option for getting in touch with us.  We continue to welcome github issues for questions, ideas, or other discussions.  But for those who want a more real-time discussion we now have a chat solution setup at Zulip.

Join us by creating an account at <a href="https://threadly.zulipchat.com/">https://threadly.zulipchat.com/</a>.  Some points of interests are the <a href="https://threadly.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/235837-announcements">announcements stream</a> where we will provide alerts on version releases.  In general this stream should match fairly close to when there is a post on the website.

We also have a stream for every threadly project.  On signing up you will be added to the more popoular projects, but others can be joined manually if interested.  For each project stream feel free to start a topic for your question, idea for improvement, or anything else you want to talk about.

I would like to try moving some API discussions here instead of on github issues.  If API ergonomics interest you I recommend watching both github and joining Zulip.
