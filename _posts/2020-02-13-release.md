Most notable is the move of the org.threadly.test package to the new <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly-test">threadly-test</a> archive (maven coordinates `org.threadly:threadly-test:0.1`).  This is planned to be the last release before we switch to the 6.0 API.  The <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/releases/tag/release-5.43">release details</a> as always provides complete details on included changes.
