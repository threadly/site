Today we released 6.1 of threadly which includes both performance improvements and feature improvements.  Most notably is the ability to check error states of <a href="javadocs/threadly/6.1/org/threadly/concurrent/future/ListenableFuture.html">ListenableFuture</a>'s without needing to generate an ExecutionException.  Check the <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/releases/tag/release-6.1">release notes</a> for more details as well as a list of additional features.
