Version 0.15 of auroraArc was released today.  This improves the replica weight configuration so that now weights for currently un-known servers can be pre-configured.  Hopefully making the feature easier to use by being less precise in when configuration is applied.

In addition version 0.14 was not deployed to maven central correctly.  Making the features in <a href="https://github.com/threadly/auroraArc/releases/tag/release-0.14">0.14</a> finally available.

The release artifacts can be pulled from maven central or from our tag: <a href="https://github.com/threadly/auroraArc/releases/tag/release-0.15">release-0.15</a>.
