We released the next major version of Threadly today.  7.0 brings in support for JDK 17, as well as some performance improvements with ListenableFutures and the mapping of futures.  You can read more about these changes and API's which were deprecated in this release in the <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/releases/tag/release-7.0">release notes</a>.

The <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Major-version-migration-guide">Migration Guide</a> has also been updated with instructions to update to the 7.0 release version.  As always if you are running the latest version (6.7) with no depreciated API warnings, then the next major version should be able to be updated without issue.  If you find you need help migrating or using Threadly 7.0 feel free to join us on the <a href="https://threadly.zulipchat.com/">Zulip Chat</a> or <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/issues">file an issue on GitHub</a>.
