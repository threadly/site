Yesterday AuroraArc version 0.16 was released to maven central.  This version only includes an update of our dependent artifacts.  Notably this requires the minimum supported JVM version to be increased to 11+, but also brings in compatibility with JDK17.

Speaking broadly AuroraArc is basically ready for a 1.0 release.  However I have not had been able to do as much testing on it recently as I would like.  If anyone is making use of this driver we would really like to collaborate and make sure the project remains stable and useful.
