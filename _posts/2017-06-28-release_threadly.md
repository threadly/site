After months of work, released version 5.0!  This is easily the best threadly yet.  It does require the use of java 8 and newer, but that means we are also able to take advantage of java 8 performance improvements and ergonomic improvements.  I have been hesitant to release this because there is still so much more I want to do.  Other projects like <a href="https://github.com/threadly/auroraArc">auroraArc</a> have been taking more of my time.  That said, I do plan to bring some improved documentation and benchmarks out soon.  Right now the <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki">wiki</a> is the best source of information, but if anyone would like to help improve this website it would be greatly appreciated!.
