Threadly 6.6 was released today.  This release provides improvements to <a href="javadocs/threadly/6.6/org/threadly/concurrent/future/FutureUtils.html">FutureUtils</a> and <a href="javadocs/threadly/6.6/org/threadly/util/StatisticUtils.html">StatisticUtils</a>.  These changes are fairly minor as development has recently been more stable and slower.  I still have plans for more significant changes (as described in GitHub issues), but recently I have had less time to work on this project.

You can read more about this release in the <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/releases/tag/release-6.6">release notes</a>.
